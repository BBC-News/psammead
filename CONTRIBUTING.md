# Contributing

We welcome feedback and help with Psammead. By participating in Psammead, you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/blob/latest/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please take a moment to read it.

We appreciate all forms of contribution - not just code. Contribution can include adding documentation, requesting clarification, making typo corrections and much more.

Psammead has a "Definition of Done" which applies to changes proposed to its main branch, `latest`. When you make a pull request, please check that your contribution matches this.

## Definition of Done

**Component Structure**

As discussed in the [README](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/blob/latest/README.md), Psammead is a library of shared components following the [container / components pattern](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0). Whether you are creating a component from scratch, or preparing to move an existing React component to Psammead, make sure that your component is presentational and reusable. The component should accept props if needed and implement minimal logic. A presentational component shouldn’t handle either fetching or mutation of data.

A component should have this file structure:

```
├── README.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── src
│   ├── __snapshots__
│   │   └── index.test.jsx.snap
│   ├── index.jsx
│   ├── index.stories.jsx
│   └── index.test.jsx
```

The `src/` folder is necessary for separation of concerns, as a `dist/` folder containing the transpiled version of the component is generated at publish time. The `dist/` folder will contain the transpiled version of any `.jsx` files in the `src/` folder (saved as ES5 `.js`), with the exception of `*.stories.jsx` and `*.test.jsx` files.

NB: the `__snapshots__` directory is optional.

**package.json**

The `package.json` is namespaced with `@bbc/psammead-*` e.g. `@bbc/psammead-headings`.

Include the following authorship and repository information in your package. Replace the team name and email address if appropriate.

```
  "author": {
    "name": "BBC Psammead Maintainers",
    "email": "PsammeadMaintainers@bbc.co.uk"
  },
```

```
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/tree/latest/packages/psammead-headings"
  },
```

Also make sure you define the entry-point to the transpiled version of your component:

```
  "main": "dist/index.js",
```

For example, if your component's main entry-point is `src/foo.jsx`, you should point `"main"` to `"dist/foo.js"`.

**Tests**

- When you run `npm test` all unit tests should pass and there should be 100% test coverage of the component.
- No JS or CSS lint errors should be present.
- Your component should be fully accessibility-tested. There's a [test guide for testers](https://bbc-news.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-news-and-testers) and a [checklist for developers](https://bbc-news.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-news-and-developers) as well as guides for [designers](https://bbc-news.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-news-and-designers), [business analysts](https://bbc-news.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-news-and-business-analysts), [product owners](https://bbc-news.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-news-and-product-owners) and [project managers](https://bbc-news.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-news-and-project-managers).

**CHANGELOG**

The changelog should follow the following convention:

```
# PackageName Changelog

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 0.1.0 | [PR#49](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/pull/49) Initial creation of package |
```

**README**

The `README.md` should cover the following territory:

```
## Description
(high-level summary that will be accessible to product/UX/Test, plus link to Storybook, explain the different cases)
## When to use this component
(including where it is currently used)
## When to not use this component
(if this is not known, can leave the section empty)
## Accessibility notes
(ensuring they make sense to non-technical audiences)
## Roadmap
(what we have planned for this component)
## Additional notes
(link to any relevant ADRs)
```

In addition, the `README.md` should also point to Psammead's [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/blob/latest/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/blob/latest/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide, and [LICENSE](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/blob/latest/LICENSE).
