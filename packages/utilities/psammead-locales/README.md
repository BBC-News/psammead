This package provides a collection of locale configs, used in BBC World Service sites.

## Exports

`/moment/ig` - A [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) locale for Igbo. This can be used to localise timestamps generated using moment.js.
`/moment/pcm` - A [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) locale for Pidgin. This can be used to localise timestamps generated using moment.js.
`/moment/yo` - A [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) locale override for Yoruba. This replaces some translations as requested for BBC News World Service. Note that importing this will also cause the upstream `yo` locale to be loaded.
`/numerals` - Numerals in several different number systems, e.g. Bengali, Burmese, Eastern Arabic, Western Arabic. This can be used for localised numbers for components. Returns arrays of the format `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10'];`
