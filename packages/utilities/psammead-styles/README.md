This package provides a collection of string constants for use in CSS, containing non-GEL styling details that are bespoke to specific BBC services and products

## Exports

`/colours` - Project-defined colours that will be required by multiple Psammead components or themes. These colours are not defined by GEL.
`/fonts` - Project-defined font families. These fallbacks are not defined by GEL.

## Installation

```jsx
npm install @bbc/psammead-styles --save
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { C_POSTBOX } from '@bbc/psammead-styles/colours';

import { FF_NEWS_SANS_REG } from '@bbc/psammead-styles/fonts';
```

These values can then be used directly within CSS declarations in code:

```jsx
import { css } from 'styled-components';

const SomeStyledComponent = css`
  background-color: ${C_POSTBOX};
  font-family: ${FF_NEWS_SANS_REG};
`;
```

## Contributing

When **adding** a new export to this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-styles/index.test.jsx#L11-L35) also need to be updated. When **removing** an exisiting export from this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-styles/index.test.jsx#L11-L35) need to be updated and the package version requires a major change (EG: 1.2.1 -> 2.0.0) as this would be considered a breaking change due to functionality being removed.
