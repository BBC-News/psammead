This package is a collection helper methods used for snapshot testing, with support for styled components.

## Installation

```jsx
npm install react react-dom @bbc/psammead-test-helpers --save-dev
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { shouldMatchSnapshot } from '@bbc/psammead-test-helpers';

shouldMatchSnapshot(
  'should render correctly',
  <h1>Hello World</h1>,
);
```

## Functions

| Name                       | Arguments        | Description  |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| shouldMatchSnapshot        | title, component | Renders the component using react-test-renderer, converts it to JSON and asserts that it matches the given snapshot, which will be saved in the `__snapshots__` directory. The first argument `title` is the title for the test. |
| shallowRender              | component        |  Shallow renders the component using react-test-renderer and returns the render output |
| shouldShallowMatchSnapshot | title, component | Shallow renders the component using react-test-renderer and asserts that it matches the given snapshot, which will be saved in the `__snapshots__` directory. The first argument `title` is the title for the test. |
| isNull                     | title, component    | Renders the component using react-test-renderer, converts it to JSON and asserts that it is null. The first argument `title` is the title for the test. |

## Roadmap

There is currently a plan to migrate from `react-test-renderer` to `enzyme` as it provides a nicer higher-level API over the same functionality, as well as having support for more granular unit tests.
